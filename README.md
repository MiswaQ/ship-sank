## The rules of the game!
<br>
<br>
When the game starts it will show a text with short explenation about the game.
The user will then be prompted to add a user name.
After the user chooses a name the game will start.
In the start of the game the user will see a board that looks empty.
That is because the boats are hidden.
Now the user will have 7 tries to hit 5 ships.
The user will have a choice of 00 - 99.
If the user puts in 1 or 01 will be the same up until 9 (09).
As there is 100 places the ships can be at that means that the user
will get 100 choices to find the ships.
